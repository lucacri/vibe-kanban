Vibe Kanban exposes a local MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing you to manage projects and tasks from external MCP clients like Claude Desktop, Raycast, or even coding agents running within Vibe Kanban itself.

<Note>
This page covers connecting **external MCP clients** to Vibe Kanban's MCP server. For configuring MCP servers **within** Vibe Kanban for your coding agents, see the [MCP Server Configuration](/integrations/mcp-server-configuration) guide.
</Note>

<Info>
Vibe Kanban's MCP server is **local-only** - it runs on your computer and can only be accessed by applications installed locally. It cannot be accessed via publicly accessible URLs.

## Setting Up MCP Integration

### Option 1: Using the Web Interface

This works if you're adding the Vibe Kanban MCP server to any [supported coding agent](/supported-coding-agents) **within** Vibe Kanban.

1. In Vibe Kanban Settings, navigate to the "MCP Servers" page
2. In the "Popular servers" section, click on the Vibe Kanban card
3. Click the `Save Settings` button

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

You can manually add the MCP server to your coding agent's configuration. Add the following configuration to your agent's MCP servers configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe_kanban": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vibe-kanban", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using MCP with Coding Agents

Once you have the MCP server configured, you can leverage it to streamline your project planning workflow:

1. **Plan Your Work**: Describe a large feature or project to your coding agent
2. **Request Task Creation**: At the end of your task description, simply add "then turn this plan into tasks"
3. **Automatic Task Generation**: Your coding agent will use the Vibe Kanban MCP server to automatically create structured tasks in your project

## Example Usage

### External Coding Agents

```
I need to build a user authentication system with the following features:
- User registration with email validation
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset capability
- Session management
- Protected routes

Then turn this plan into tasks.
```

The coding agent will break this down into individual tasks and add them to your Vibe Kanban project automatically.

### Internal Coding Agents (Within Vibe Kanban)

A powerful workflow involves using coding agents within Vibe Kanban that are also connected to the Vibe Kanban MCP server:

1. **Create a Planning Task**: Create a task in "plan mode" within Vibe Kanban
2. **Explore and Plan**: The coding agent explores the codebase and develops a comprehensive plan
3. **Generate Sub-Tasks**: Ask the coding agent to "create a series of individual tasks for this plan"
4. **Automatic Population**: The agent uses the MCP server to populate individual tasks directly in the Vibe Kanban interface

This creates a seamless workflow where high-level planning automatically generates actionable tasks in your project board.

## Installation Instructions for MCP Clients

### Raycast Example

Raycast is a popular MCP client that can connect to Vibe Kanban's MCP server. Here's how to configure it:

For complete Raycast MCP configuration details, see the [official Raycast MCP documentation](https://manual.raycast.com/model-context-protocol).

</Frame>

Configure the Vibe Kanban MCP server in Raycast by adding the server details.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Step 2: Supply Command">
<Frame>

<Note>
Similar configuration steps apply to other MCP clients like Claude Desktop, VS Code with MCP extensions, or any custom MCP client implementations.
